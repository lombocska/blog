Now, here we are again. As I've mention in my last post, I was attending in HeackYeah hackathon, Warsaw in 24-25 November 2018.

### HeackYeah, Warsaw


With 2 of my colleagues I went to participate on a hackathon in Warsaw. Our participation was possible because of the INPUT program organized by [Barnabas Csikos](https://www.facebook.com/csikos.barnabas).
Thanks for it anyway! :)


The event itself was okay, I can say that. It was well-organized and fun to be there. Unfortunately, not all of the
sponsors and organizers were able to speak in English, I mean, I was surprised to experience that since I thought
it an international event. 

##### Tasks, decisions... 

All of the task are listed here: https://hackyeah.pl/tasks.html
With my team we had decided to create a solution for the `WIN THE LOTTO` [task](https://hackyeah.pl/WIN_WITH_LOTTO-DETAILS.pdf).
Unfortunately, the vast majority thought the same, so our chance was quite slim. 
We were about doing something great and developing an amazing solution, but after talked to one of the mentors we had realized
it's not that event and we should make a `designed` solution like never before... You know we are Backend Developers, so
it didn't go like a clockwork.

Our idea was was named Gamblers & Gladiators and imagined as a built-in app in Messenger. We used InVision for making a nice mockup.
 

We hadn't earn any prices, but at the end of the day we were satisfied with out product and agreed to go another hackathon as well. :)
