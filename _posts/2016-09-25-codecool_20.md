### 11. Self instructed-Week //2016.09.19-2016.09.23//

In this week we had to continue to learn the design patterns and start to get to know  the JavaScript programming language.
At the begging of the week I made three different lectures on [codeacademy](www.codeacademy.com):
- Learn JavaScript
- JavaScript
- jQuery

Among them I got to like the jQuery thanks to codeacademy, where the tasks were very cool. :)

Then came the design patterns.
Uhm, so it is very useful. The task had two part:
- one: State
- another: codecooler daily routine
The repo is [here](https://github.com/CodecoolBP20161/python-design-pattern-exercises-part-2-lombocska.git).


Overall, I enjoyed this week.
