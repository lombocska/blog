And, it's happened. My very first conference in London. This was an undoubtedly amazing and complex event for a developer like me.

### O'Reilly Software Architecture Conference 2018.10.28-29, London Hilton Metropole

After got the green light to organize the travelling and ticket buying part of the conference, it didn't take so much time to
make it real. We were 5 of us who were lucky enough to chose this conference for visiting. 

We fathomed the agenda thoroughly to filter the most appropriate and intriguing talks like `Potholes in the road from monolithic hell: Microservices adoption anti-patterns`
 of Chris Richardson.
 
Basically, for me this conference was profitable since before I didn't even know what I hadn't known thus 
my knowledge has been expanded as much as never before in parallel with my brain burning out. I was on the verge of a breakdown
because sometimes I wasn't on the ball as there were some speakers who spoke so fast in tech language with all of the abbreviations 
I hadn't known that firstly it was dissatisfying. 

Then I moved heaven and earth to get the gist and actually, the challenge was rewarding. 

Coming back to the point, the talks were mostly about microservices, serverless, messiging, kafka, devOps.


#### Serverless
My personal favourite topic is serverless. There were a couple of talks about it and I'd read the book
[What is serverless?](https://www.oreilly.com/programming/free/what-is-serverless.csp) of Mike Roberts and John Chapin 
co-founders of the Symphonia Serverless and cloud technology consultancy. 

After headed home, we prepared with a presentation for our colleagues to share some keynotes with them from the conference.

## Present

Last but not least, nowadays I have ants in my pants again and started to work on a business project at my company, Falcon.io.

The high-level design was planned by our staff senior engineer and succeeded marvelously. We got the ball rolling
and my task was to create a microservice for linkedin with the help of [spring-social](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-social) 
and [spring-social-linkedin](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-social-linkedin) libraries.
Because of the need of being suitable for thethe variety of networks like facebook, twitter, whatsapp etc, I had to do it as a generic app
thus spring-boot-starter app was created as a "parent project" to [autoconfigure](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-developing-auto-configuration.html)
and lay the foundation for the other child projects. 

There were an upgrade from `java 1.8 to java 11` and another from spring-boot-starter `2.0.5.RELEASE` to `2.1.0.RELEASE` what's caused a problem
in our kafka client version, so the upgrade wasn't so easy but luckily kafka client is backward compatible, so I pulled kafka-client as well 
based on the [compatibility matrix](https://spring.io/projects/spring-kafka).

This project was instructive for me as at the beginning I was just whistling in the dark, but now I've finished it
and I'm exuberant.

## Imminent Future
With 2 colleagues we've applied for [HackYeah](https://hackyeah.pl/index.html) 24-hour hackathon, in Warsaw, Poland
and got the opportunity to participate on it. So let's see ...what's next. :)
