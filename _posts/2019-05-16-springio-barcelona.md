I think this conference was really cut out for our knowledge and we can do our best at it.

To let the cat out of the bag immediately, I will start with the best sessions.

1. My favourite was about the [clean architecture from Tom Hombergs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPH5AiqLQTo&t=1s). His speech about Hexagonal Architecture was really
impeccable and valuable. 

2. My colleagues mentioned the [Bootiful TDD session from Josh Long](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87XhgYBM-Y) as an amazing experience. AFAIK Josh Long covered a lot of ground and was really quick and understandable and motivating.

3. The third place goes for [Spring Cloud Contract session from Billy Conrado](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrpY3V-O4lE). He absolutely hits the nail in the head.



I can recommend to watch the [Youtube channel of Spring I/O](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLMPXsvSrhNPN3i9h-u8PYg/videos) to learn a lot form it.  





Now let's call it a day and go to sleep like a log!

I will try to write a post about [Falcon.io life](https://www.linkedin.com/company/falconio/life/f974449a-4b21-4600-82b5-e66f76e0cf98/) to show how can be your workplace the best place. 

Bye! :)
