I had the luck to be part of the European Women in Tech Conference in Amsterdam organized since 2016. 
This conference was rather for meeting other like-minded women, than picking up new useful knowledge or going deeper in a known topic.

Due to that fact I was surprised and a bit disappointed. The other thing that I have to say honestly, that I was tongue-tide at the
beginning of the first day since I always use English in the written form, but speech. As usual, I was full of beans, so
my muteness disappeared soon. :) 


After two, exhausting days spent chatting and sharing knowledge with inspiring attendees I hadn't time for visiting Amsterdam thoroughly.
At the end of the first day there was only one hour to go out and seek for some food.



To cut a long story short, I am quite grateful for the opportunity to my [company](https://www.falcon.io/) to support
events like this and leave my to be myself freely.


Funny fact, that from Amsterdam I couldn't come back home since I "had" to go to the Falcon XMas party to Copenhagen. 
Poor me.... :) 


#### Last but not least, my fav place in CPH
