Sooo....I lost for a long time, but now I'm here. Bunch of things happened to me since my last post, so let's start from the beginning.

### My very first year as a DEVELOPER // March 2017 - April 2018 //

After having finished my studies at [Codecool](https://codecool.com/) I started to work at E-Radius as a Full Stack Developer with a very cool team. 


### Falcon // May 2018 -  //

Since May 2018 I started to work as a Backend Engineer at [Facon.io](https://www.falcon.io/). After 1 and half month I can say I'm fond of this workplace.
My colleagues are so nice, helpful and smart so I can learn a lot from them.
