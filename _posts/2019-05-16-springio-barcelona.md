I think this conference had a bunch of topics which were really useful for our team.

Let me start with the most intriguing sessions:

1. My favourite was about [clean architecture from Tom Hombergs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPH5AiqLQTo&t=1s). 
His speech about Hexagonal Architecture was really impressive and valuable. 

2. My colleagues mentioned the [Bootiful TDD session from Josh Long](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87XhgYBM-Y) was an amazing experience. 
AFAIK Josh Long covered a lot of ground and was really quick, understandable and motivating.

3. The third place goes to [Spring Cloud Contract session from Billy Conrado](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrpY3V-O4lE). 
He absolutely hit the nail on the head.



I would recommend watching the [Youtube channel of Spring I/O](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLMPXsvSrhNPN3i9h-u8PYg/videos) 
to learn more about the best practices and cutting-edge technologies.  





Soon I am going to write a post about [Falcon.io life](https://www.linkedin.com/company/falconio/life/f974449a-4b21-4600-82b5-e66f76e0cf98/) to show you more about what we are up to.
