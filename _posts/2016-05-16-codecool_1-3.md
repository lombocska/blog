#### 1.TeamWork-Week  ‚Äì  //2016.04.25-2016.04.29//




At the beginning of the week we formed mini groups. My mini group called ACT (Adult Coding Turtles) has 6 members (3 girls and 3 boys). We complete each other in the common tasks very well.

We started to use the Scratch than we got a project, named [Coding Morning](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/107239803/). We had to create a game that has 3 ‚Äúrooms‚Äù.



#### 1.Self-instructed Week  ‚Äì //2016.05.02-2016.05.06//




The last week was the first self-learning week (SI-Week). I was naive and I believed I had enough time for everything (big sleep, yoga, cinema with my friends, etc.)because this is SI-Week I‚Äôm at home and so on‚Ä¶..Hahaha!  On Monday I was writing my thesis all day. Next day I watched several new lectures in Canvas and I was afraid of the whole thing. I had to fill in 1 quiz about Ubuntu (Terminal, etc.) and I had to write two assignments in Python.

One of the tasks was about the ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù, but not the simple version, so we had to write a code in a mode that needs a ‚Äûsys.argv‚Äù command. If the user types his own name via the terminal in a certain line in which the user starts Python, the program should show ‚ÄúHello XY!‚Äù, but if the user doesn‚Äôt fill in the command line the program has to show ‚ÄúHello World!‚Äù

The other task was about making a simple calculator.

During my tasks I found some very useful pages on web. For example:

- http://www.programiz.com/python-programming

- http://stackoverflow.com/


If it hadn‚Äôt been enough I had to ‚Äúpush‚Äù these assignments to GitHub. So I had to learn how to use GitHub from the command line. Fortunately here are a helpful page for GitHub:

- https://try.github.io

In GitHub I had to create a [new repository](https://github.com/lombocska/hello_world_lombos.monika) and use command line to commit and push to this repository the final version of the assignments.


In the evenings I practiced some other scripts that help the beginners. This page helps the beginner programmer during the first steps:

- https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python


Until Friday I had been able to finish all the assignments but this week was hard for me.
I had never learnt so many new things before.


Bonus: At the weekend I could write the end of my thesis and it seems to be ready. So, from now I can focus on programming.

So during the first SI-Week I learnt:

- how to use the command line in Terminal
- how to use Atom
- how to definite in Python
- how to use sys.argv
- how to push and commit to GitHub
- and so on‚Ä¶.


And the most important I learnt how to ask help in an understandable way.



#### 2.TeamWork-Week ‚Äì //2016.05.09-2016.05.13//




At the beginning of the week we ourselves had to make a ToDo list in Python and we had to implement the ‚Äú100Doors‚Äù game. We got 1 day for this tasks. Then we received a huge project.üôÇ So we had to do a game that the user can play in the Terminal (console game). My pair and I chose the snake. Our notions were like this:

- we had to make 2 modes for the game: the user can choose between the modes of the snake. In one of the modes the snake can go through the wall, in the other one not

- we make 4 levels


Until Friday we had been able to finish our plan and the game was ready. On Friday we could watch the implementation of the other group. Then we gave feedback to each other and to the mentors.

End of story ‚Ä¶Until the next post.üôÇ
