11. Self instructed-Week //2016.09.19-2016.09.23//

In this week we had to continue to learn the design patterns and start to get to know  the JavaScript programming language. (www.codeacademy.com) 
At the begging od the week I made three different lectures on codeacademy:
- Learn JavaScript
- JavaScript
- jQuery
Among them I got to like the jQuery thanks to codeacademy, where the tasks were very cool. :)

Then came the design patterns.
Uhm, so it is very useful. The task had two part:
- one: State 
- another: codecooler daily routine
The repo is [here].


Overall, I enjoyed this week.
